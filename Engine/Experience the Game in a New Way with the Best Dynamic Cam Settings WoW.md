## What is DynamicCam?
 
DynamicCam is an addon that allows you to customize your camera behavior in World of Warcraft. It can automatically adjust your camera zoom, pitch, angle, shoulder offset and more depending on various factors, such as your character's movement, combat status, environment, interaction with NPCs and enemies, etc.
 
DynamicCam uses the ActionCam feature that was added back to the game in patch 7.1. ActionCam is a hidden option that changes the way the camera moves and follows your character. It can make your game feel more dynamic, realistic and engaging by adding some subtle effects, such as head bobbing, camera shaking, depth of field and motion blur.

## How to Install and Use DynamicCam?

The options menu consists of four tabs: General, Situations, Advanced and Profiles. Here is a brief overview of each tab:
 
- General: This tab lets you enable or disable DynamicCam, as well as some global settings like mouse wheel zoom speed, camera collision detection, head tracking and reaction speed.
- Situations: This tab lets you create and manage different situations with different camera settings and rules. A situation is a set of conditions that trigger a specific camera behavior. For example, you can have a situation that zooms in your camera when you are indoors, or another one that rotates your camera when you are teleporting. You can also enable or disable the predefined situations that come with the addon.
- Advanced: This tab lets you fine-tune some advanced settings like shoulder offset interpolation, zoom smoothing, pitch smoothing and more. You can also enable or disable some experimental features like dynamic pitch and dynamic shoulder offset.
- Profiles: This tab lets you save and load different profiles with different settings. You can also export and import profiles from other users.
