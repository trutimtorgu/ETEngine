## History and Development of the Code
 
The Pakistan Penal Code 1860 has a long and complex history that dates back to the colonial era. The code was originally drafted by Lord Macaulay, a British politician and historian, who chaired the First Law Commission of India in 1834. The commission was tasked with preparing a comprehensive and uniform code of criminal law for India, which was then under British rule. The commission consulted various sources, such as the English common law, the French Penal Code, and the Code of Louisiana, to draft a code that was suitable for the Indian context. The draft was completed in 1837 and submitted to the Governor-General of India, but it was not enacted until 1860, after several revisions and debates. The code was called the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and it applied to all territories under British India. [^1^]

The IPC was one of the first codifications of criminal law in the common law world. It was widely praised for its clarity, simplicity, and comprehensiveness. It also influenced the development of criminal law in other countries, such as Singapore, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, etc. The IPC was based on the principle of secularism and did not incorporate any religious laws or customs. However, it also reflected some of the biases and prejudices of the colonial rulers, such as the criminalization of homosexuality, sedition, and blasphemy. [^1^]
 
After Pakistan gained its independence from British India in 1947, it inherited the IPC as its own penal code. However, over time, Pakistan made several amendments to the code to reflect its own political, social, and religious realities. Some of the major amendments include: [^1^]
 
- The introduction of Islamic laws such as Qisas (retribution), Diyat (blood money), Arsh (compensation for bodily injury), Daman (compensation for hurt not liable to Arsh), and Ta'zir (discretionary punishment) in 1990.
- The introduction of harsher punishments for offences against Islam, such as blasphemy, apostasy, and defiling the Quran in 1982.
- The introduction of offences related to terrorism, cybercrime, honour killing, acid throwing, etc. in various years.

Today, the Pakistan Penal Code 1860 is still the main source of criminal law in Pakistan. It has been amended more than 70 times since its enactment. It is also subject to interpretation by the courts and application by the police and prosecutors. The code has been praised for its adaptability and resilience, but also criticized for its inconsistency and ambiguity. The code also faces challenges from human rights activists, civil society groups, religious minorities, etc., who demand reforms and revisions to make it more compatible with modern standards of justice and equality.
